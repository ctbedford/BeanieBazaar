executive_summary_phase:
  _critical_takeaway: "UK RMNs, powered by extensive loyalty card data (Nectar, Clubcard, Asda Rewards), offer brands potent omnichannel advertising opportunities with increasingly sophisticated self-serve options, granular audience segmentation, and closed-loop attribution connecting media spend to both online and in-store sales."

# üî¨ Phase 4: EVIDENCE, ELUCIDATION & TRANSPARENCY
# Purpose: To clarify the sources and acknowledge limitations in the data for RMNs.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
evidence_and_transparency_phase:
  _critical_takeaway: "Findings on RMN capabilities are based on their public announcements, corporate websites, and industry reports; however, granular details on API specifications, spend floors, and the full extent of self-serve functionalities are typically gated behind direct commercial engagement."

  data_sourcing_and_methodology:
    primary_sources: "RMN websites (Nectar360, dunnhumby for Tesco), retailer corporate news (Morrisons, Asda), partner announcements (LiveRamp, SMG)."
    secondary_sources: "Retail technology news sites (Retail Technology Innovation Hub, InternetRetailing), marketing industry publications (Think with Google, Econsultancy, The Drum), market research summaries (Grand View Research)."
    information_nature: "Capabilities are generally well-described; specific technical details for APIs and commercial terms like spend floors are less public."
  confidence_level_and_limitations:
    confidence:
      - "High for general capabilities, partnerships, and stated data sources (e.g., loyalty programs)."
      - "Medium for the specifics of self-serve vs. managed service models, as these can evolve and have varying tiers."
      - "Low for precise, universally applicable spend floors and detailed API documentation, as these are typically part of direct negotiation and partner onboarding."
    limitations:
      - "Detailed technical specifications for booking APIs are not publicly available."
      - "Minimum spend requirements can vary by advertiser, campaign type, and over time."
      - "The RMN space is rapidly evolving, so capabilities and platform details can change frequently."
