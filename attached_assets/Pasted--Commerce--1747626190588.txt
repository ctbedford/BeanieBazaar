# Purpose: To introduce the second research focus area: UK Retailer Profiles and their incentive models.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
session_kick_off_and_alignment:
  _critical_takeaway: "Adapting Commerce-OS for the UK requires a deep understanding of each major retailer's operational rhythms, supplier engagement models (like JBP cadence), and buyer motivations, which can differ significantly from US counterparts."
  _section_tldr: "This session focuses on Node 2: 'Retailer Profiles & Incentive Models', detailing fiscal calendars, JBP approaches, and typical buyer objectives for key UK grocery retailers."
  session_topic_and_purpose: "Exploration of Node 2: Retailer Profiles & Incentive Models for Tesco, Sainsbury‚Äôs, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi, Lidl, Ocado, and Costco. The purpose is to understand their operational frameworks and how to engage effectively."
  key_objectives_for_this_discussion:
    - "Review fiscal calendars and typical Joint Business Planning (JBP) cadences for each key retailer."
    - "Discuss generally understood Buyer OKRs and margin considerations in the UK grocery sector."
    - "Identify differences and nuances compared to US retailer engagement models."
  agenda_overview_and_scope:
    - "Recap of the overall research spine and importance of retailer-specific knowledge."
    - "Detailed breakdown for each target retailer:"
      - "Fiscal calendars and financial reporting rhythm."
      - "Inferred JBP cadence and supplier collaboration approaches."
      - "General buyer objectives and margin context (noting limitations on confidential data)."
    - "Discussion of portability and strategic implications for Commerce-OS."

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üí° Phase 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CORE INSIGHTS
# Purpose: To provide a high-level overview of the engagement landscape with major UK retailers.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
executive_summary_phase:
  _critical_takeaway: "UK retailers operate on varied fiscal calendars, generally engage in annual or bi-annual JBP cycles with ongoing dialogues, and their buyers focus on volume, value, category growth, and margin delivery, though specific OKRs and margin rules are confidential and highly nuanced."
  _section_tldr: "Understanding individual UK retailer timelines and engagement styles is crucial; while detailed buyer OKRs are private, their general objectives align with achieving category leadership and profitability."
  summary_of_retailer_engagement_models:
    - "Fiscal calendars vary: Most major grocers (Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons) have year-ends in Feb/March or around October for Morrisons. Ocado's is typically December. Costco aligns with its US parent (end of August)."
    - "JBP Cadence: While specific timelines are not public, JBPs are typically annual or bi-annual, supported by regular category reviews and performance discussions. Supplier portals and engagement programs (e.g., Aldi, Lidl) suggest continuous communication channels."
    - "Buyer OKRs & Margin Rules: Specific internal OKRs and margin structures are confidential. Buyers are generally incentivized by sales growth (volume and value), market share gains within their category, profitability (margin percent and cash margin), stock availability, successful new product introductions, and effective promotional planning. Margins are negotiated and vary widely by category, brand power, and strategic importance to the retailer."
  key_implications_for_commerce_os:
    - "Platform must accommodate diverse fiscal reporting and planning cycles."
    - "Tools supporting JBP preparation, performance tracking, and scenario modeling will be valuable for UK teams."
    - "While specific margin rules aren't programmable, analytics should help suppliers understand their contribution to retailer category goals."

  recap_of_key_insights:

  strategic_considerations_for_commerce_os:

    - "Analytics should focus on demonstrating value to retailer category strategies (growth, profitability, share) as a proxy for meeting buyer OKRs."
