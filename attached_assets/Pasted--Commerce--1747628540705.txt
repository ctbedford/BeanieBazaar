# Purpose: To introduce the tenth research focus area: Supply-Chain & Fulfilment challenges and considerations in the UK.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
session_kick_off_and_alignment:
  _critical_takeaway: "Navigating the UK's supply chain requires a keen understanding of variable lead-times influenced by global and local factors, significant retailer depot penalties for non-compliance, complex post-Brexit duty and VAT structures, all of which critically impact promotional planning and out-of-stock (OOS) risk."
  _section_tldr: "This session delves into Node 10: 'Supply-Chain & Fulfilment', examining typical UK logistics lead-times, the prevalence and nature of depot penalty fees, customs duty costs, and how these elements affect promo calendars and OOS risk for CPG brands."
  session_topic_and_purpose: "Exploration of Node 10: Supply-Chain & Fulfilment in the UK. The purpose is to identify key logistical challenges, cost drivers (penalties, duties), and their strategic implications for inventory management, promotional activities, and overall operational efficiency for brands entering or operating in the UK."
  key_objectives_for_this_discussion:
    - "Review typical factors affecting supply chain lead-times for goods entering and moving within the UK."
    - "Understand the common practices and financial impact of depot penalty fees imposed by UK retailers."
    - "Outline the current landscape of UK customs duties and VAT for imported CPG goods, particularly post-Brexit."
    - "Analyze how these supply chain variables influence promotional planning and contribute to OOS risks."
  agenda_overview_and_scope:

      - "The linkage between supply chain performance, promotional effectiveness, and stock availability."
    - "Discussion of portability (🔀 adapt – supply chain is highly localized) and strategic implications for Commerce-OS."

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 💡 Phase 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CORE INSIGHTS
# Purpose: To provide a high-level overview of critical supply chain and fulfilment factors in the UK.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
executive_summary_phase:
  _critical_takeaway: "The UK supply chain is marked by increased fragility and complexity due to global events and post-Brexit adjustments, leading to volatile lead-times, stringent retailer compliance demands with financial penalties, and new customs duty/VAT considerations. These factors directly heighten OOS risks and necessitate agile promotional planning."
  _section_tldr: "Brands in the UK must navigate a challenging supply chain landscape characterized by potential delays, retailer penalties for non-compliance (e.g., missed deliveries, incorrect labelling), and post-Brexit trade friction, all of which can derail promotions and lead to lost sales from OOS."
  summary_of_uk_supply_chain_and_fulfilment:
    - "Lead-Times: Variable and subject to disruptions from port congestion, customs delays (post-Brexit), global shipping issues (e.g., Red Sea, Ukraine conflict), and labor shortages (HGV drivers). Price increases for perishable goods are expected more quickly during tariff impacts due to inability to stockpile."
    - "Depot Penalty Fees: Common practice among UK retailers. Over 50% of suppliers have faced penalties for non-compliance with terms like delivery deadlines, quality issues, and labelling errors. Average fines can be significant (£1,658, some >£5,000), and 20% of suppliers have lost business due to non-compliance."
    - "Duty Costs & VAT: Post-Brexit, imports into the UK are subject to customs duties (rates vary by product) and import VAT. The UK government has temporarily suspended tariffs on some food items until 2027. Options like Duty Deferment Accounts and Postponed VAT Accounting can help manage payments."
    - "Impact on Promo Calendars & OOS Risk: Supply chain disruptions (47% of UK businesses experienced an increase in the last year) directly affect product availability, making promotional planning challenging and increasing OOS risk. Retailers may expedite stock via air freight for key items, impacting costs. Poor on-shelf availability (OSA) leads to lost sales for both retailers and manufacturers (estimated at 4% and 2.3% of annual sales, respectively)."
  key_implications_for_commerce_os:
    - "Commerce-OS should ideally incorporate features that help users track inventory levels, anticipate potential OOS situations, and adjust promotional plans accordingly based on supply chain realities."
    - "Integrations with logistics and inventory management systems could provide valuable data feeds."
    - "The platform could help manage documentation or compliance checklists related to UK import/retailer requirements, though this is a complex area."
