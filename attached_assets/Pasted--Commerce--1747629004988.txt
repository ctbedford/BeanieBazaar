#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ü§ù Phase 1: SESSION KICK-OFF & ALIGNMENT
# Purpose: To introduce the sixteenth research focus area: UK Rapid-Commerce & Aggregator platforms.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
session_kick_off_and_alignment:
  _critical_takeaway: "UK rapid-commerce platforms like Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Ocado Zoom offer emerging advertising (sponsored listings) and integration (API feeds) opportunities for CPG brands, though navigating SKU management and the dynamic nature of this 'low/opportunistic' priority channel requires careful consideration."
  _section_tldr: "This session explores Node 16: 'Rapid-Commerce & Aggregators', examining Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Getir, and Ocado Zoom. We'll look at their advertising features, API capabilities for partners, and challenges like SKU duplication, understanding these are UK-adapted (üîÄ) channels to be approached opportunistically."
  session_topic_and_purpose: "Exploration of Node 16: Rapid-Commerce & Aggregators in the UK. The purpose is to understand the sponsored listing opportunities, API feed availability for integration, and SKU management considerations on platforms like Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Getir, and Ocado Zoom, to inform potential opportunistic engagement for brands via Commerce-OS."
  key_objectives_for_this_discussion:
    - "Review the key rapid-commerce and aggregator platforms operating in the UK (Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Getir, Ocado Zoom)."
    - "Discuss their offerings for sponsored listings and advertising for CPG brands and retail partners."
    - "Outline the availability and general capabilities of their API feeds for menu/catalog management, orders, and other integrations."
    - "Analyze the common challenges related to SKU duplication and product information management on these platforms."
  agenda_overview_and_scope:
    - "Overview of the UK rapid-commerce (q-commerce) landscape and its relevance for CPG brands."
    - "Detailed profile for each target platform:"
      - "Sponsored listing and advertising features."
      - "API feed capabilities for partners."
      - "SKU management challenges and considerations."
    - "Discussion of portability (üîÄ adapt ‚Äì UK market specifics) and the 'Low/Opportunistic' priority for engagement via Commerce-OS."

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üí° Phase 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CORE INSIGHTS
# Purpose: To provide a high-level overview of the UK rapid-commerce landscape regarding advertising, APIs, and SKU management.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
executive_summary_phase:
  _critical_takeaway: "Leading UK rapid-commerce players like Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Ocado (via Ocado Ads for Zoom) are developing retail media offerings with sponsored listings. They also provide partner APIs for menu, order, and catalog management, which can help mitigate SKU duplication issues. Getir's direct CPG advertising tools are less publicly detailed. This channel remains opportunistic and requires careful integration."
  _section_tldr: "UK q-commerce platforms offer advertising and API integration opportunities for brands, though SKU consistency can be a challenge. Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Ocado are more advanced in their retail media offerings than Getir based on public information. This is an adaptive (üîÄ) and opportunistic channel."
  summary_of_uk_rapid_commerce_and_aggregators:
    - "Sponsored Listings & Advertising: Deliveroo ('Marketer Adverts', 'Deliveroo Media and Ecommerce' with Criteo), Uber Eats ('Sponsored Listings', 'Sponsored Items' with Criteo), and Ocado ('Ocado Ads' via Zitcha, covering Ocado Zoom) offer advertising solutions for partners and FMCG brands to boost visibility and sales within their apps/websites."
    - "API Feeds & Integration: Deliveroo and Uber Eats provide comprehensive API suites for partners (restaurants, retailers) covering menu/catalog management (including stock, pricing, images), order processing, and site operations. Ocado, through its broader retail operations, also has sophisticated integration capabilities. These APIs are crucial for managing listings and inventory in real-time."
    - "SKU Duplication & Management: While platform APIs allow direct partners to manage their catalogs, SKU duplication can still arise from multiple independent sellers or inconsistent data entry on aggregator platforms. Effective PIM and data synchronization via APIs are key for brands to maintain consistency. The challenge is greater where brands have less direct control over how their products are listed by numerous small, localized dark stores or restaurants."
    - "Platform Variation: Deliveroo and Uber Eats have fairly well-documented advertising and API offerings. Ocado Ads provides a full-funnel retail media network applicable to Ocado Zoom. Public information on Getir's specific CPG advertising tools and extensive supplier APIs is less prominent in recent findings, reflecting potential shifts in the dynamic q-commerce market."
  key_implications_for_commerce_os:
    - "Commerce-OS could explore offering connectors to the APIs of major rapid-commerce platforms (Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Ocado) for product listing, inventory, and order management for CPG brands that sell through these channels or partner with dark stores/restaurants."
    - "The platform could help brands manage and syndicate product information (PIM-like features) to ensure consistency and reduce SKU duplication issues on these aggregator sites."
    - "Given the 'Low/Opportunistic' priority, integrations should be considered based on demonstrated client demand and the stability/standardization of platform APIs."

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üèóÔ∏è Phase 3: DETAILED STRUCTURE & ANALYSIS
# Purpose: To present the detailed findings for the "Rapid-Commerce & Aggregators" node.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
detailed_analysis_phase:
  _critical_takeaway: "Engaging with UK rapid-commerce platforms offers opportunistic avenues for brand visibility and sales, primarily through sponsored listings and direct integrations via APIs. However, brands must actively manage their product data to combat SKU duplication and navigate a fast-evolving market with varying levels of advertising sophistication among players."
  _section_tldr: "This section details Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Getir, and Ocado Zoom, focusing on their advertising options, API capabilities for partners, and the inherent challenges of SKU management in the q-commerce space. These require UK-adapted approaches and are considered opportunistic."

        question_bank:
          - "What types of sponsored listings or advertising opportunities do Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Getir, and Ocado Zoom offer to CPG brands or retail partners in the UK?"
          - "What API feed capabilities (for product catalogs, inventory, orders, etc.) do these platforms provide for integration by their partners (restaurants, retailers, CPG brands with direct listings)?"
          - "What are the common issues or best practices related to SKU management and preventing product duplication when listing products on these rapid-commerce platforms?"
          - "How do the advertising and integration offerings differ across these key UK rapid-commerce players?"
        key_findings:
          - rc_platform_profile:
              platform_name: "Deliveroo"
              sponsored_listings_and_advertising:
                - "'Marketer Adverts': Cost-per-click (CPC) service for partners to boost visibility in high-traffic spots (Featured, Offers, Popular Brands, search results). Options for continuous or one-off campaigns, automated or manual bidding." (Deliveroo Learning Centre)
                - "'Deliveroo Media and Ecommerce': Broader advertising platform launched (initially UK, with Criteo) for consumer FMCG brands, including ads on order tracker page, website, app, and through social/email/push campaigns, alongside sponsored search. Enables brands to provide samples via Editions kitchens and HOP stores." (New Digital Age)
              api_feeds_and_integration:
                - "Offers extensive API suites: 'Partner Platform Suite' (orders, menus, site status for restaurants), 'Retail Platform Suite' (catalogue API for up to 30k items, picking API for grocery/retail), and 'Signature Suite' (custom delivery experiences using Deliveroo couriers)."
                - "Menu API allows updates to stock status, pictures, prices, POS IDs, allergen info from partner's in-store system." (Deliveroo API Docs)
              sku_management_considerations:
                - "Catalogue API for retail partners helps manage master catalogues, which should aid in SKU consistency for direct partners."
                - "General challenge for brands if products are listed by many independent restaurants/stores with varying data quality. Centralized brand management of product information is advisable where possible."
          - rc_platform_profile:
              platform_name: "Uber Eats"
              sponsored_listings_and_advertising:
                - "'Sponsored Listings': Allows restaurant partners to improve visibility at the top of Uber Eats listings. Managed via self-serve Uber Eats Manager platform, with performance tracking (clicks, orders)." (Uber Help)
                - "'Sponsored Items': Launched in the UK (powered by Criteo) for FMCG brands to have product listings directly on the Uber Eats app, targeting ready-to-purchase consumers. PepsiCo was an early UK partner." (Criteo Investor Room)
                - "In the US, Uber Eats partnered with Instacart for 'Carrot Ads' to expand CPG advertising reach; UK model currently emphasizes Criteo partnership for Sponsored Items." (DesignRush)
              api_feeds_and_integration:
                - "Provides a comprehensive Marketplace API suite covering: Menu API (get/upsert menu, update items), Order API (manage orders), Store API (manage store details/status), Promotions API, and Reporting API." (Uber Developers, Postman)
                - "Integration timelines typically 4-8 weeks. Requires NDA and API licensing agreement."
              sku_management_considerations:
                - "Menu API allows partners to manage their product listings, which is key for SKU accuracy for those directly integrated."
                - "Similar to other aggregators, ensuring consistent SKU representation can be challenging if multiple third-party sellers list the same brand's products without central oversight."
          - rc_platform_profile:
              platform_name: "Getir"
              sponsored_listings_and_advertising:
                - "Primary focus of recent public information has been on Getir's own brand marketing campaigns (e.g., 'you've got it' TV ads) to build consumer awareness and establish its 'ultrafast grocery delivery' proposition in the UK." (Getir Press Release)
                - "Specific details on sponsored listing programs for CPG brands within the Getir app were not prominent in the immediate search results, unlike Deliveroo and Uber Eats. This area may be less developed or less publicly promoted for third-party brands."
              api_feeds_and_integration:
                - "Information on publicly available, extensive supplier/partner APIs for catalog management or broad CPG integration was not readily found in the initial search snippets. Their model historically relied on their own dark stores, which implies internal PIM/inventory systems."
              sku_management_considerations:
                - "As Getir operates its own dark stores, SKU management would primarily be an internal operational function. If they onboard third-party retail partners more broadly, SKU consistency would become a shared challenge."
                - "The rapid commerce sector is volatile; Getir's market position and partnership offerings should be continuously monitored."
          - rc_platform_profile:
              platform_name: "Ocado Zoom (via Ocado Ads)"
              sponsored_listings_and_advertising:
                - "Ocado Retail launched 'Ocado Ads' in September 2024, a full-funnel retail media network powered in partnership with Zitcha. This platform serves Ocado's main e-commerce site and by extension, would be the mechanism for advertising on its rapid delivery service, Ocado Zoom."
                - "Ocado Ads offers onsite, offsite, social media, and CTV advertising. Provides self-serve, managed, or hybrid service models."
                - "Features 'Ocado Ads Manager' for campaign management, 'Ocado Insights & Measurement' (via Beet platform), and 'Ocado Audiences'." (Ocado Retail Press, Ocado Ads website)
              api_feeds_and_integration:
                - "Ocado as a sophisticated online grocer has extensive backend systems for product information, inventory, and order management. The Ocado Ads platform integrates with these systems."
                - "Zitcha, the partner for Ocado Ads, focuses on integrating retailer businesses around their RMNs, suggesting robust data integration capabilities."
                - "Specific public-facing APIs for Ocado Zoom distinct from the broader Ocado retail/supplier integration pathways were not detailed, but supplier portals for Ocado generally cover product listing and management."
              sku_management_considerations:
                - "Ocado maintains a centralized product catalog for its main retail operations, which likely extends to Ocado Zoom, promoting SKU consistency."
                - "Brands supplying Ocado would manage their product data through Ocado's established supplier systems."
        general_sku_management_notes: "Inventory availability and accuracy are top challenges for UK retailers, including those in rapid commerce. SKU duplication and inconsistent product information can confuse consumers and impact sales. Centralized PIM and robust API integrations are key mitigations for brands and platforms."

# üî¨ Phase 4: EVIDENCE, ELUCIDATION & TRANSPARENCY
# Purpose: To clarify the sources and acknowledge limitations in the data for Rapid-Commerce & Aggregators.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
evidence_and_transparency_phase:
  _critical_takeaway: "Information on sponsored listings and API capabilities for Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Ocado is largely based on their public announcements, partner portals, and press coverage. Details for Getir's CPG advertising tools are less public. Specific advertising rates, full API technical documentation, and the rapidly evolving q-commerce market mean current details can change."
  _section_tldr: "This section confirms findings are from public and partner-facing materials. The q-commerce landscape is dynamic; precise commercial terms and deep technical API specifics require direct engagement and ongoing monitoring."
  data_sourcing_and_methodology:
    primary_sources: "Platform websites (Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Ocado Ads), API documentation portals, press releases, partner announcements (Criteo, Zitcha)."
    secondary_sources: "Retail and advertising technology news sites, industry reports on q-commerce."
    information_nature: "Published advertising offerings, general API suite capabilities, and discussions of common industry challenges like SKU management."
  confidence_level_and_limitations:
    confidence:
      - "High for the existence of sponsored listing programs and general API categories for Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Ocado."
      - "Medium for the exact current scope and self-serve maturity of all advertising features across all platforms, especially for newer entrants or those undergoing market adjustments (like Getir historically)."
      - "The 'Low/Opportunistic' priority of this node means the research is an overview rather than an exhaustive technical deep-dive into each API."
    limitations:
      - "Specific advertising costs (CPC rates, campaign minimums) are not publicly available."
      - "Full technical API documentation, including all endpoints, rate limits, and data schemas, is typically restricted to registered partners/developers."
      - "The rapid commerce market has been volatile, with business models and service offerings (including advertising capabilities) subject to rapid change or discontinuation."
      - "Comprehensive data on the prevalence and impact of SKU duplication specific to each UK platform is not readily available."

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - "Market Dynamics: The rapid commerce sector is known for its rapid evolution, including market entries, exits, and consolidations. The capabilities and stability of platforms should be assessed on an ongoing basis."
  strategic_considerations_for_commerce_os:
    - "Evaluate the strategic fit and ROI potential before prioritizing integrations with specific rapid-commerce platform APIs, given the 'Low/Opportunistic' nature of this channel for some CPGs."
    - "If pursued, Commerce-OS should focus on providing tools to streamline product information syndication (to combat SKU duplication) and potentially aggregate sales/performance data from these platforms."
    - "Help users understand the varying advertising capabilities and costs associated with each q-commerce platform."

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üèÅ Phase 6: CONCLUDING THOUGHTS & PATH FORWARD
# Purpose: To conclude the review of the sixteenth node and outline next steps.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
concluding_thoughts_and_path_forward:
  _critical_takeaway: "Node 16 provides an overview of the UK's rapid-commerce channel, highlighting opportunistic advertising and integration points alongside operational challenges. The next node will explore the more traditional, yet still crucial for some categories, Out-of-Home / HORECA channel."
  _section_tldr: "Having assessed the fast-paced q-commerce landscape, the research will now turn to the Out-of-Home and HORECA sector, which presents different types of opportunities and challenges for CPG brands, particularly those in the beverage or food service supply chain."
  summary_of_node_completion: "The 'Rapid-Commerce & Aggregators' node outlines the key players, their advertising and API offerings, and SKU management considerations in the UK q-commerce market, noting its opportunistic but evolving nature."
  next_steps_in_research_spine:
    - "Proceed to Node 17: 'Out-of-Home / HORECA Channel' to investigate major distributors like Brakes and Bidfood, trends in hotel and office coffee, listing fees, and demand drivers relevant for CPG brands (especially relevant for 'Coffeeway' as noted in the original table)."
    - "Consider how Commerce-OS might, if at all, support brands engaging with the distinct requirements of the HORECA channel."
  call_to_action_or_discussion_points:
    - "For which CPG categories or specific brands would engagement with UK rapid-commerce platforms be most strategically beneficial?"
    - "What are the key technical or operational hurdles for integrating with these platforms' APIs via Commerce-OS?"
    - "Given the 'Low/Opportunistic' priority, what level of resource should be allocated to developing capabilities for this channel within Commerce-OS?"
