# ü§ù Phase 1: SESSION KICK-OFF & ALIGNMENT
# Purpose: To introduce the ninth research focus area: an internal FitMap of PathX modules against identified UK market needs.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
session_kick_off_and_alignment:
  _critical_takeaway: "Successfully launching Commerce-OS in the UK hinges on a thorough internal assessment of our existing PathX modules: identifying what can be leveraged, what needs adaptation, and where new development or resources are required to meet specific UK market demands."
  _section_tldr: "This session introduces Node 9: 'Internal Capability FitMap', a critical internal exercise to evaluate the readiness of PathX modules for the UK, focusing on reusability, adaptation needs, and resource gaps. This node provides a framework for that internal analysis."
  session_topic_and_purpose: "Initiation of Node 9: Internal Capability FitMap PathX modules to UK needs. The purpose is to guide the internal team in systematically evaluating existing PathX capabilities against the specific requirements of the UK commerce environment identified in previous research nodes (1-8)."
  key_objectives_for_this_discussion:
    - "Understand the process and importance of the PathX FitMap for UK market entry."
    - "Review the key questions guiding the assessment of each PathX module regarding reusability and necessary adaptations (connectors, functionality)."
    - "Identify the process for flagging development, data, and legal resource gaps based on this FitMap."
    - "Outline expected outputs and next steps following the internal FitMap analysis."

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üí° Phase 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CORE INSIGHTS
# Purpose: To provide a high-level overview of the objectives and expected outcomes of the internal PathX FitMap.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
executive_summary_phase:
  _critical_takeaway: "The PathX FitMap is an essential internal due diligence process that will determine the technical and resource roadmap for adapting Commerce-OS to the UK. It requires a module-by-module evaluation against UK retailer practices, RMN capabilities, data provider ecosystems, regulatory requirements, and consumer trends identified in earlier research."
  _section_tldr: "This internal assessment will map existing PathX modules to UK needs, distinguishing between reusable components, those needing adaptation (especially connectors), and potential gaps requiring new development or resource allocation (dev, data, legal)."
  summary_of_fitmap_objectives:
    - "Objective 1: Systematically review each existing PathX module for its applicability and readiness for the UK market."
    - "Objective 2: Identify which modules are directly re-usable (‚öñÔ∏è), which require adaptation (üîÄ - e.g., new connectors, UI localization, regulatory adjustments), and which UK needs have no current PathX solution (‚ùó - requiring net-new development)."
    - "Objective 3: Quantify the effort for adaptation and new development, specifically highlighting needs for new or modified data connectors (e.g., for UK retailers, RMNs, data providers)."
    - "Objective 4: Pinpoint specific development, data (e.g., access to UK-specific datasets, data science expertise for UK models), and legal/compliance (e.g., UK GDPR nuances, HFSS, EPR expertise) resource gaps that must be addressed."
  expected_outcomes_of_fitmap:
    - "A clear inventory of PathX modules categorized by UK readiness (re-usable, adapt, new)."
    - "Prioritized list of adaptation and new development requirements, with a focus on critical connectors."
    - "An initial estimate of resource requirements (dev, data, legal) and potential timelines."
    - "Input for build-vs-buy decisions for missing functionalities or connectors."

concluding_thoughts_and_path_forward:
  _critical_takeaway: "The output of this internal PathX FitMap (Node 9) will be a cornerstone document, directly influencing the feasibility, timeline, and resource planning for the Commerce-OS UK expansion. Subsequent nodes will further refine operational and strategic considerations."
  _section_tldr: "Once the internal team completes this FitMap, the path to UK deployment will be much clearer, allowing for focused efforts on development, partnerships, and addressing resource gaps. The research then continues into supply chain and trade promotion specifics."
  summary_of_node_guidance: "This node provides a structured framework to guide the essential internal task of assessing PathX module suitability for the UK. Its completion by the internal team is a prerequisite for effective UK adaptation planning."
  next_steps_in_research_spine_post_internal_fitmap:
    - "Internal teams to conduct the FitMap using this guide and findings from Nodes 1-8."
    - "Once the FitMap is drafted, proceed to Node 10: 'Supply-Chain & Fulfilment' to understand UK-specific lead times, depot penalties, and duty costs."
    - "Subsequently, explore Node 11: 'Trade-Promotion Mechanics' to analyze UK norms for funding, scan-backs, and retailer margin asks."
    - "The results of the FitMap will be crucial input for prioritizing work related to supply chain and trade promotion support within Commerce-OS for the UK."
  call_to_action_for_internal_team:
    - "Schedule internal workshops with relevant stakeholders (Product, Engineering, Data, Legal) to conduct the PathX module review."
    - "Assign owners for assessing specific modules or functional areas against UK requirements."
